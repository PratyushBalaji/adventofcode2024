# Advent Of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge hosted every year in December. 


## What's This Repo?
I've been (not very consistently) participating in AoC since 2022, so this year I have decided to attempt to solve **every puzzle**.

I'm posting my solutions online for others to see, whether it be to learn from it (unlikely), offer feedback (very likely), or just view.

My goal is to solve both part 1 and 2 of every AoC question this year as they come out.

This repo did originally contain my inputs for each of the days' puzzles, but [at the request of AoC's creator](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying), it no longer does. 
If you too are planning on participating this year or in the future, read through the [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) first.
